Data Analyst focused on Marketing & Web and Customer & Behavior analytics.

About Me
-------------

Hello! I’m a data analyst with a foundation in data science and a proven ability to turn complex data into insights that drive business decisions. My career has been shaped by hands-on experience with SQL, Python, and dashboarding tools, and I’ve developed a specialty in product, marketing, and behavioral analytics. From optimizing user journeys to uncovering growth opportunities, I bring a balance of technical skill and strategic thinking to every project.

I thrive in fast-moving environments where experimentation and curiosity are valued, and I’m passionate about making data accessible across teams. Whether collaborating with product managers, marketers, or leadership, I focus on clear communication and actionable outcomes.

Outside of work, I stay inspired by running, exploring NYC, and diving into creative side projects that push me to learn and build (like this portfolio website!). I’m always looking for new ways to grow and new challenges to solve with data.
